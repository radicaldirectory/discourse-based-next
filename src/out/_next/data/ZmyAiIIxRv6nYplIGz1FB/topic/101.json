When VicForests logs outside the boundaries set out in the Allocation Order, VicForests is logging and selling timber that has not been vested to it.</p>\n<p>Danya Jacobs, Lawyer for Environmental Justice Australia, said: “The allocation order cannot legally grant timber to VicForests if it doesn’t identify where that timber is. If the Department is right that the map in the order is too poor to know whether any given logging operation is taking allocated timber or not, then it raises the prospect that the order has not effectively granted VicForests property in any timber at all. The result being that VicForests logging operations may have been unlawful everywhere since 2013.”</p>\n<p>Ed Hill, Forest Campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: “The logging regulator, the Environment Department, doesn’t know if it’s Arthur or Martha. This latest mapping excuse from the department further demonstrates that when it comes to enforcement, the department has neither the fortitude nor capability to ensure VicForests complies with the law.</p>\n<p>“The environment department has consistently failed in its role as the regulator of VicForests. This is why there is an independent expert panel review its capability and capacity to effectively regulate VicForests and the adequacies of its prosecution policies, procedures and practices.”</p>\n<p>Wilderness Society Victorian Campaigns Manager Amelia Young said: “If this Environment Department was in charge of land titles, you could claim half your neighbour’s property and say the map was too fuzzy to prove otherwise. If this government is using fuzzy PDF maps to build the Metro Tunnel, it could come out in the middle of the Yarra.</p>\n<p>“If the government can’t say whether or not VicForests is logging inside or outside the Allocation Order anywhere across eastern Victoria — which is the effect of its statement — then how can Victorians, or the markets, be confident that any of VicForests logging conducted under this Allocation Order since 2013, is above board?”</p>\n<p>VicForests sells wood from Victoria’s native forests to Nippon-owned paper manufacturer, Australian Paper, which manufactures brands including Reflex products. VicForests wood products are also sold by retail giants Officeworks and Bunnings.</p>\n<p>Ms Young said: “There are serious questions over VicForests’ ability to responsibly and sustainably manage Victoria’s native forests.</p>\n<p>“In a few days we’ll have a new Victorian government. VicForests may not be not best placed to manage Victoria’s publicly owned native forests. VicForests must stop logging in all high environmental value forests immediately.”</p>\n<p>Ms Jacobs said: “These are clearly deep problems. There is a crisis with forest regulation in Victoria, which is paralleled by the crisis in the ecology of the forests themselves. Mountain Ash forests are listed as Critically Endangered under international criteria, and yet our regulatory system permits logging to continue in that forest. We are seeing species dependant on these forests uplisted to Critically Endangered, and species that were once common are now rare and threatened.</p>\n<p>“Now, we find out that VicForests appears to have been logging timber that doesn’t belong to it and the government’s response is effectively that it’s not sure what forest it has handed over to VicForests. This issue is in desperate need of leadership from government.”</p>\n<p><strong>For further comment contact:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Friends of the Earth Forest Campaigner Ed Hill on 0414 199 645</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wilderness Society Victoria Campaign Manager Amelia Young on 0404 074 577</strong></p>\n<p><strong>For more information, contact Wilderness Society media adviser Alex Tibbitts on 0416 420 168</strong></p>\n<p>[i] <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-21/victorian-forests-appear-to-have-been-logged-illegally/10496424\">www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-21/victorian-forests-appear-to-have-been-logged-illegally/10496424</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/7.30/government-owned-logging-company-accused-of/10520270\">www.abc.net.au/7.30/government-owned-logging-company-accused-of/10520270</a></p>\n</details>\n<h2>Response to independent review of logging regulation GECO / TWS / FoE</h2>\n<details>\n<summary>\nRead Article</summary>\n<blockquote>\n<p>POSTED BY ED HILL ON MARCH 26, 2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Wilderness Society and Goongerah Environment Centre and Friends of the Earth</p>\n<p>Independent Review of Timber Harvesting Regulation ​joint ​​response</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/original/1X/6a2eaba4c92fc6d00fbee522b8d44ec6a01eae40.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"f9kBnBVegDBy2Acbd8QCI71JNUA\" width=\"154\" height=\"145\"><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/original/1X/54a982dc5a0ce98fa09b36165956e2587fd3cae1.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/54a982dc5a0ce98fa09b36165956e2587fd3cae1\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/54a982dc5a0ce98fa09b36165956e2587fd3cae1_2_238x81.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"c4XhzUhcCQC9hRDQ7mhFDuvCc5X\" width=\"238\" height=\"81\" srcset=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/54a982dc5a0ce98fa09b36165956e2587fd3cae1_2_238x81.jpeg, https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/54a982dc5a0ce98fa09b36165956e2587fd3cae1_2_357x121.jpeg 1.5x, https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/54a982dc5a0ce98fa09b36165956e2587fd3cae1_2_476x162.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/54a982dc5a0ce98fa09b36165956e2587fd3cae1_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\"></span><span class=\"informations\">709×241 51.6 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/original/1X/44441dc81ca89d1520b1606515f9fba2946f1f87.png\" data-download-href=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/44441dc81ca89d1520b1606515f9fba2946f1f87\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/44441dc81ca89d1520b1606515f9fba2946f1f87_2_219x93.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"9JUpcPJbgOtmZeauuGEtOQyXm1F\" width=\"219\" height=\"93\" srcset=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/44441dc81ca89d1520b1606515f9fba2946f1f87_2_219x93.png, https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/44441dc81ca89d1520b1606515f9fba2946f1f87_2_328x139.png 1.5x, https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/44441dc81ca89d1520b1606515f9fba2946f1f87_2_438x186.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/44441dc81ca89d1520b1606515f9fba2946f1f87_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\"></span><span class=\"informations\">790×336 78.1 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\n<p>The Independent Review identified several deeply problematic issues within DELWP’s approach to regulation of logging.</p>\n<p>It found that DELWP does not see itself as a regulator, it is an ineffective regulator, and that VicForests is essentially self-regulating.</p>\n<p>The independent panel’s findings highlight need for government to set policy and take decisive action.</p>\n<p>GECO and the Wilderness Society warn that strengthened regulation of the logging industry will not ensure environmental, cultural and economic values of forests are protected and enhanced.</p>\n<p>Wider policy change from government is required to ensure best use and value of forests, and protection of these values—including climate and water values—for future generations.

As Victoria’s timber harvesting regulator, it is the role of DELWP to enforce compliance with this framework on behalf of the Victorian community.”</p>\n<p>GECO and the Wilderness Society warn that strengthened regulation of the logging industry will not ensure environmental, cultural and economic values of forests are protected and enhanced.</p>\n<p>Wider policy change from government is required to ensure best use and value of forests, and protection of these values—including climate and water values—for future generations. Improved industry compliance and a strengthened regulator sits within this broader context.</p>\n<p>The myriad of issues the review has unearthed highlights the need for the government to complete reform of the logging industry. Completing transition of the industry out of high environmental value native forests and into plantations and recycled fibre, with fair processes for workers, is urgently needed.</p>\n<p>After decades of mismanagement Victoria’s forests are badly overlogged. Today, almost all logging in what is left of Victoria’s forests is occurring in environmentally sensitive areas.</p>\n<p>All changes DELWP makes in light of the review recommendations must be evaluated against the social, economic and environmental cost of continued logging in high environmental value native forests.</p>\n<p>Ed Hill Forest campaigner Goongerah Environment Centre / Friends of the Earth said:</p>\n<p>“We welcome Environment Minister Lily D’Ambrosio’s commitment to strengthen DELWP’s regulatory capability and capacity however the strictest regulation and enforcement does not offer a solution to solve the ongoing environmental crisis in our forests caused by unsustainable logging, said Ed Hill”</p>\n<p>“The absence of policy certainty for industry and conservation must be resolved before any more effort is directed to working out how to better regulate an industry that is already on a pathway to inevitable change”</p>\n<p>Amelia Young, Campaigns manager Wilderness Society Victoria said:</p>\n<p>“This review is another clarion call to Premier Andrews for clear and decisive action to complete the industry’s transition out of native forests and info plantations, create fair and just pathways for workers, and to protect forests and threatened wildlife. He must clear up the confusion.”</p>\n<p>“For almost five years now Premier Andrews has abrogated his responsibility as leader to clear up this mess. The result is an ongoing crisis in our forests, deeply uncertain industry workers, a community disappointed that special forests still aren’t protected and dismayed that VicForests continues to log illegally.”</p>\n<p>Ed Hill Forest campaigner Goongerah Environment Centre / Friends of the Earth said:</p>\n<p>“Regulatory enhancement is only part of the solution here. Decisive action to get the logging industry onto a sustainable footing, and to protect forests, is also required from government and must be prioritised.”</p>\n<p>“The review found that VicForests’ secretiveness about logging hampers DELWP’s ability to regulate effectively. Yet again, VicForests’ conduct is found wanting.”</p>\n<p>Amelia Young, Campaigns manager Wilderness Society Victoria said:</p>\n<p>“It is positive that DELWP has accepted all 14 recommendations made by the independent review panel. However while important, these reforms are not a solution, as even improved regulation cannot make an inherently unsustainable logging industry sustainable.”</p>\n<p>“While the independent review makes some sound assessments, and DELWP’s responses to them are fairly credible, neither the review, the recommendations made, nor the response from DELWP deal with the elephant in the room: the massive volumes of wood committed to Nippon-owned Australian Paper through the state legislated wood pulp agreement. So long as hundreds of thousands of tonnes of forest is dedicated for paper pulp, it will be impossible for DELWP to properly regulate logging in ever-diminishing forests to anything near acceptable standards.”</p>\n<p>“We have called for a truly independent logging regulator, which enforces the code without fear or favour. The extent to which VicForests continues to log high environmental value forests in breach of the law will be a key test of whether DELWP transforms into a regulator that protects the environment, rather than turns a blind eye to its destruction.”</p>\n<p>ENGO responses to some of the review recommendations</p>\n<p>Recommendation 4, to change the focus from the point of harvesting, to the point of planning, is welcome as it should mean earlier intervention is possible to prevent harm.</p>\n<p>This will require exerting greater control over where and when VicForests can and cannot go into certain coupes. The DELWP pre-logging survey program is experiencing challenges with VicForests rushing to go into logging coupes and then DELWP has to rush to complete a survey. This is a reactive not a proactive approach that focuses on the planning stage. In order to do this DELWP will need to work more closely with the Department of Jobs, Precincts and</p>\n<p>Regions (DJPR) to exert greater control over VicForests. Urgency to log in order to meet wood supply obligations should not come at the expense of proper and thorough planning that makes sure all required regulatory processes are fulfilled.</p>\n<p>Recommendation 8, to write a prosecution policy, is welcome as departmental unfamiliarity with the regulatory requirements has hampered a willingness and ability to act. However we note that the review panel identified that DELWP does not utilise the full range of regulatory tools and strategies available to it, and that this ought to be improved (Recommendation 9).</p>\n<p><strong>ENGO responses to some of DELWP’s proposed actions</strong></p>\n<p>Chief Conservation Regulator / Office of Conservation Regulator</p>\n<p>Establishing a Chief Conservation Regulator with a stand alone office combining all parts of the department with regulatory responsibilities is a step in the right direction.</p>\n<p>This concept will in theory lead to more independent oversight and a stronger regulatory culture within DELWP, however without government action to reform the logging industry the new office will struggle to be effective. Additionally, it is not clear how the Chief Conservation Regulator of the Office of Conservation Regulator will ensure assessment, in addition to community and industry engagement, at the planning stages.</p>\n<p>The government must act to place the logging industry on a sustainable footing by reducing timber volumes, transitioning jobs, protecting high environmental value forests at the same time as establishing the new office of conservation regulation. Any efforts to reform regulation through the creation of new roles and offices,without fundamental reform of the logging industry, will face an uphill battle.</p>\n<p>The statement of regulatory intent for timber harvesting</p>\n<p>The draft statement of regulatory intent highlights the inherent contradiction in managing forests for multiple values. It includes an admission that it is not possible to avoid impacting environmental, social, cultural values of native forests when logging them, but goes on to say that the regulatory framework for timber harvesting exists to ensure (in vain) logging is conducted in a way that is compatible with the conservation of these values, including so that they are protected and enhanced for current and future generations.</p>\n<p>For government to expect the department to effectively regulate whilst in denial of this inherent contradiction is to risk failure and likely perpetuate many of the problems that beset industry and its regulator.</p>\n<p>Environment groups will provide further comment about the draft statement of regulatory intent and appreciate the invitation to do so.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater Glider example:</strong></p>\n<p>The review makes an explosive revelation that DELWP has in fact completed its work to identify logging prescriptions and risk management strategies for the Greater Glider.2 However, agreement across government has not yet been reached on timber harvesting prescriptions (Page 24).</p>\n<p>This examples highlights the highly politicised environment that DELWP and regulation of logging operates within. It is the responsibility of the Minister and DELWP to implement protections for the Greater Glider, agreement from the whole of government is not required. However in this case it is the whole of government that are delaying action to better protect the Glider. As a result logging in continuing in high quality habitat that may be required to be protected under DELWP’s proposed prescriptions.</p>\n<p>This highlights the urgent need for the government to take decisive action to address the protection of the greater glider, and indeed many other species, and reform the logging industry so that it can be appropriately regulated.</p>\n<p>The Independent Review highlighted the example of the threatened forest species the Greater Glider as illustrative of the inflexibility of the regulatory framework and DELWP’s lack of meaningful action to address the impact of logging on the species through an action statement (Page 24).</p>\n<p>The Greater Glider is a forest dependent threatened species that has been listed as vulnerable to extinction under state legislation (Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act) since July 2019. Despite clear scientific evidence that logging is a driver of the species’ decline, no protections have been implemented for the species and logging continues in high quality habitat.</p>\n<p>The required action statement, that sets out guidance for what protections should be applied and enforced by DELWP, has not been released and communication about the progress of the action statement, from government and DELWP to stakeholders, has been highly guarded.</p>\n<p>1 Available at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.forestsandreserves.vic.gov.au/forest-management/environmental-regulation-of-timber-harvesting\">https://www.forestsandreserves.vic.gov.au/forest-management/environmental-regulation-of-timber-harvesting</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/gecoforests/pages/2271/attachments/original/1553506839/Independent_Review_of_Timber_Harvesting_Regulation_Report.pdf?1553506839\">Copy of the independent review report </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/gecoforests/pages/2271/attachments/original/1553506755/DELWP_Response_to_the_Independent_Review_of_Timber_Harvesting_Regulation_%281%29.pdf?1553506755\">Copy of DELWP response to Independent review</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/gecoforests/pages/2271/attachments/original/1553507033/DELWP_capacity_and_capability_to_regulate.pdf?1553507033\">Copy of GECO / TWS submission to Independent review </a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/gecoforests/pages/2271/attachments/original/1553506731/_DELWP_ind_review_Media_brief_full_.pdf?1553506731\">Copy of GECO / TWS response to findings of Independent review </a></p>\n</details>\n<h2>Survey on Regional Forest Agreements: Our Sample Responses</h2>\n<details>\n<summary>\nRead Article</summary>\n<blockquote>\n<p>POSTED BY JILL KOPPEL ON JUNE 25, 2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/original/1X/e631898b80a721c555bc39cf08380b90a69964c3.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/e631898b80a721c555bc39cf08380b90a69964c3\" title=\"Extinction Crisis: Our chance to have our say on Victoria&amp;#39;s RFAs\"><img src=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e631898b80a721c555bc39cf08380b90a69964c3_2_650x208.jpeg\" alt=\"Tanglefoot picnic area: logging operation barely disguised behind trees\" title=\"Extinction Crisis: Our chance to have our say on Victoria's RFAs\" data-base62-sha1=\"wQnWYYyat5AEyklNrJFL65an11V\" width=\"650\" height=\"208\" srcset=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e631898b80a721c555bc39cf08380b90a69964c3_2_650x208.jpeg, https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e631898b80a721c555bc39cf08380b90a69964c3_2_975x312.jpeg 1.5x, https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e631898b80a721c555bc39cf08380b90a69964c3_2_1300x416.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/e631898b80a721c555bc39cf08380b90a69964c3_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Extinction Crisis: Our chance to have our say on Victoria&amp;#39;s RFAs</span><span class=\"informations\">2657×849 365 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></h4>\n<p>The following Sample Responses have been prepared by members of the FOE Forest Collective to assist forest lovers and activists to complete the <a href=\"https://engage.vic.gov.au/future-of-our-forests/rfa-consultation-paper\">Survey on Regional Forest Agreements</a> which forms part of the consultation phase on the <em>Modernisation of the Victorian Regional Forest Agreements.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong><em><strong>UPDATE</strong></em> Your response must be completed by midnight Sunday, 7 July 2019.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Use the following Sample Responses to guide your completion of the survey (in your own words).

What changes have you seen in the RFA regions?</h4>\n<p>Sawmills closed, river and creek water levels down, plants and animals killed, local economies trashed, farmers worried.</p>\n<h4>Q 2. What should the Victorian RFAs aim to achieve over the next 20 years?</h4>\n<p>The RFAs should be allowed to lapse, to expire at the end of their current extended term, meaning a full transition away from native forest logging.</p>\n<h4>Q 3. What are the potential improvements you think should be made?</h4>\n<p>During transition, remove the RFA exemption from the Commonwealth Environment Protection &amp; Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act), unique to the logging industry, to put it on the same basis as any other industry that could impact EPBC listed species.</p>\n<p>Discontinue extraction of pulp logs from native forest in the transition period, referred to in RFAs as residual logs. This erroneously suggests such logs remain after a greater quantity has gone to sawlogs, but under the RFAs the amount of pulp logs has increased about seventy times beyond the 1937 residual amount (5000 cu.m.), and sawlogs are downgraded to meet pulp log quotas.</p>\n<p>Meet the commitment for 350,000 cu.m./year pulp logs to Australian Paper until 30 June 2030 from sources outside native forest or else terminate the contract (if there is a problem with availability).</p>\n<h4>Q 4. How could the potential improvements in the consultation paper help modernise the Victorian RFAs?</h4>\n<p>Manage forests for conservation, water supply, tourism, other economic &amp; social opportunities, and accept that wood production, export woodchipping and paper pulp have depleted our forest at unsustainable levels.</p>\n<p>Any further development of the wood &amp; paper products industry should use plantation sources, which will be more economically viable when not competing with a subsidised logging industry in public native forests.</p>\n<h4>Q 5. Do you have any views on which potential improvements are most important?</h4>\n<p>In the face of the current climate emergency, maintaining intact native forests as a carbon sink is the best course of action for the public estate.</p>\n<h4>Q 6. How do you use forests in your region?</h4>\n<p>I regularly visit the forest, bear witness to biodiversity loss, and I am saddened by the decline in numbers of threatened species.</p>\n<h4>Q 7. How could the RFAs better provide for multiple forest uses (i.e. recreation, conservation, livelihood and economy)?</h4>\n<p>By terminating the unsustainable native forest logging industry and lapsing the RFAs.</p>\n<h4>Q 8. What are your views on existing environmental protections afforded across the entire forest estate (including parks, reserves and State forests) through the RFAs?</h4>\n<p>Environmental protections are woefully inadequate, connectivity is lacking, limiting re-colonisation of Cool Temperate Rainforest and Cool Temperate Mixed Forest (both listed Threatened Communities in Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act) into areas where they previously occurred. With climate impacts increasing, the State Government has a duty of care to maintain forest integrity, especially in areas of Wet Sclerophyll forest containing Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans), the tallest of all flowering trees.</p>\n<h4>Q 9. How could the environmental protections be improved?</h4>\n<p>As noted above, remove the RFA exemption from the EPBC Act, which is unique to the logging industry, like any other industry that could impact EPBC listed species.<br>\nTransition jobs away from public native forest, adopt longer rotations for trees in plantations for future timber supply, not just for paper.</p>\n<h4>Q 10. What opportunities could the RFAs provide to support access to and traditional use of forests by Traditional Owners and Aboriginal people?</h4>\n<p>Get logging out of native forests so there are still some values intact on country for traditional custodians.</p>\n<h4>Q 11. How could the RFAs enable the legal rights of Traditional Owners to partner in land management and seek economic and cultural opportunities to be realised in future forest management?</h4>\n<p>Create opportunities for first nation stakeholder groups to have custodianship restored within a multiple purpose reserve system.</p>\n<h4>Q 12. How could the RFAs consider climate change and other large-scale natural disturbances (including bushfires)?</h4>\n<p>Accept scientific reports linking logged forest areas (for timber and paper production) to dryer landscapes, loss of rainforest understorey species and consequently an increased fire-risk.</p>\n<p>Regeneration burns after logging further add to this risk, and do not meet the same regulatory standards that are imposed on other industries for incineration of waste.</p>\n<p>Restoration of Cool Temperate and Warm Temperate rainforest species reduces fire risk.</p>\n<h4>Q 13. How could the RFAs better address industry sustainability?</h4>\n<p>Ensure adequate funding for establishing plantations and manage for longer rotations so they can supply timber not just paper.</p>\n<h4>Q 14. How could the RFAs encourage investment and new market opportunities for forest-based industries (including the forests and wood products industry, tourism, apiary and emerging markets such as carbon)?</h4>\n<p>Carbon sequestration is the most important investment for the future, as it is critical to achieving emission reduction targets. Other viable uses and industries (water security, beekeeping, seed supply for plant nurseries) are compatible where forest is retained.</p>\n<p>Supply of water from the de-salination plant is equal to the loss of catchment water yield after logging.</p>\n<h4>Q 15. How can the RFAs support the adaptive management of Victoria’s forests in response to emerging issues (e.g. major bushfires) and opportunities (e.g. emerging industries)?</h4>\n<p>There should be no experimentation at the expense of threatened species habitat, under any guise. Ecologically sustainable forest management (ESFM) is best evaluated away from public native forest, with plantations for timber &amp; paper, using accounting &amp; inventory systems realistic for a viable future resource.</p>\n<h4>Q 16. What areas of research would better equip us to sustainably manage Victoria’s forests?</h4>\n<p>Current research shows that the forest has been managed unsustainably under the RFAs, and needs the opportunity to recover. This has resulted in increasing degradation of threatened species habitat, and diminished areas for species survival.</p>\n<p>New research could investigate ways to best achieve a recovery of lost forest values so that further extinctions can be avoided: to restore the forest to its former condition will take hundreds of years.</p>\n<h4>Q 17. How could RFA monitoring, review (including five-yearly reviews) and reporting arrangements be improved?</h4>\n<p>The RFA process to date has failed on all reporting milestones.</p>\n<p>There has been a culture of forest degradation, and there is no point in continuation of this trend.<br>\nWhen the Victorian RFAs expire, they should be allowed to lapse, and transition to new industry goals in the plantation sector implemented.</p>\n<p>Please respond to the <a href=\"https://engage.vic.gov.au/future-of-our-forests/rfa-consultation-paper\">RFA Survey here.</a></p>\n<p><strong>USEFUL BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>VIDEO EXPLAINER: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1945623385685806\">What is a Regional Forest Agreement (RFA)</a>? by Margaret Blakers (produced by the Tarkine Association Victoria)</li>\n<li>Environment NGO’s input into the RFA’s: A number of <a href=\"https://www2.delwp.vic.gov.au/futureforests/get-involved/consultation-to-date\">‘round table’ discussions</a> were held with key industry stakeholders: read the <a href=\"https://www2.delwp.vic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0022/413680/Round-Table-Environmental-NGOs-3-26-October.pdf\"><strong>Participant summary notes</strong> of the Environment NGOs.</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.wilderness.org.au/news-events/survey-help-improve-how-victorias-forests-are-managed?utm_source=breaking_news&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=button1\">Sample Survey Responses produced by The Wilderness Society (TWS)</a>.</li>\n<li>Factsheet: <a href=\"https://www.melbournefoe.org.au/tws_factsheet_rfas\">RFAs have failed to meet their core objectives, produced by the Wilderness Society</a>.</li>\n<li>Factsheet: <a href=\"https://www.melbournefoe.org.au/forests_carbon_climate\">Forests, Carbon and Climate in Victoria</a>: our old forests are carbon sinks</li>\n<li>Factsheet: <a href=\"https://www.melbournefoe.org.au/nippon_paper_wood_pulp\">Nippon Paper Industries and the Wood Pulp Agreement</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</details>\n<h2>Victorian government takes positive and welcome first step to protect native forests, more details needed environment groups say</h2>\n<details>\n<summary>\nRead Article</summary>\n<blockquote>\n<p>POSTED BY CAM WALKER ON NOVEMBER 07, 2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/original/1X/48b78729c8897b2eae55805b6099c3b057b0ca30.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/48b78729c8897b2eae55805b6099c3b057b0ca30\" title=\"Kuark_forest_Oct_2017.jpg\"><img src=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/48b78729c8897b2eae55805b6099c3b057b0ca30_2_388x291.jpeg\" alt=\"Kuark_forest_Oct_2017.jpg\" data-base62-sha1=\"anhAfOpayfJzyyZcd1TzOMU6SNG\" width=\"388\" height=\"291\" srcset=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/48b78729c8897b2eae55805b6099c3b057b0ca30_2_388x291.jpeg, https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/48b78729c8897b2eae55805b6099c3b057b0ca30_2_582x436.jpeg 1.5x, https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/48b78729c8897b2eae55805b6099c3b057b0ca30_2_776x582.jpeg 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/48b78729c8897b2eae55805b6099c3b057b0ca30_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Kuark_forest_Oct_2017.jpg</span><span class=\"informations\">1210×909 604 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>\nGoongerah Environment Centre and Friends of the Earth have today welcomed the Victorian government announcement of protection of 96,000 hectares of forests in eastern Victoria and complete and immediate protection of 90,000 hectares of old growth forest, but say more details and maps are needed to ensure the announcement results in lasting and effective protection.</p>\n<p>Goongerah Environment Centre and Friends of the Earth spokesperson Ed Hill said:</p>\n<p>“It’s very welcome to see the Andrews government finally show leadership to protect native forests, especially old growth forests in East Gippsland. This is a positive first step towards better protection of East Gippsland’s forests, but questions remain over how these promises will be implemented.”</p>\n<p>“The government needs to clearly articulate a plan for how today’s announcement of 96,000 hectares of protected areas will actually protect forests into the long term, the government must move quickly to legislate formal protection in new national parks or secure conservation reserves.”</p>\n<p>“Minister D’Ambrosio is to be congratulated on her work to secure protection for an additional 90,000 hectares of mapped old growth forest, however clarification about where these forests are located and how this policy will be implemented is urgently need. Several areas of old growth forest are being targeted for logging on VicForests current schedule, VicForest must immediately withdraw these areas from their plans and confirm that they will comply with government policy.”</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.melbournefoe.org.au/forestpressure\"><strong>Support our work to keep fighting for forests with a donation</strong></a></h3>\n<p>Goongerah Environment Centre and Friends of the Earth spokesperson Ed Hill said:</p>\n<p>“Whilst protection of forests is welcome, further work is required to reduce unsustainable wood volumes. In order to deliver the protection that our forests need wood volumes to the Australian Paper mill urgently need to be reduced before the proposed date of 2030 when native forest logging is to be phased out. Our forest and wildlife don’t have time to spare.”</p>\n<p>“While protection of some habitat for the threatened Greater Glider is welcome, until the details of the legally required Action Statement are released there is little evidence that this species will be afforded the protection required to prevent its extinction.”</p>\n<p>“We hold grave fears for how continued logging will operate in areas of high quality habitat that are not placed into protected areas. Key habitat on the Errinundra plateau and in the Bendoc state forest needs to be protected to conserve these Greater Glider hotspots in East Gippsland.”</p>\n<p>“While a lot more needs to be done, these are welcome first steps that form the building blocks of the Emerald Link reserve system in East Gippsland and the Great Forest National Park in the Central Highlands and we look forward to working with the government to deliver these proposals whilst a transition is underway.”</p>\n<p><strong>Media contact:</strong>  Ed Hill - 0414 199 645  / <a href=\"mailto:ed.hill@foe.org.au\">ed.hill@foe.org.au</a></p>\n</details>","updated_at":"2020-10-06T06:59:59.919Z"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
