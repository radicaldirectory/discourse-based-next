These deals were maintained by SDA and when helped workers terminate the deals the SDA fough tooth and nail to stop us. They spent a fortune on expensive lawyers but they lost and now workers are earning much more (with much better other conditions too) thanks to RAFFWU.</p>\n<p>If you have an old zombie agreement applying to your workplace, get together with your co-workers and unionise your workplace. We can then help you put in place the Modern Award conditions.</p>\n<p>Join the campaign here: <a href=\"https://raffwu.org.au/campaigns/industry/zombie-agreements/\">https://raffwu.org.au/campaigns/industry/zombie-agreements/</a></p>","updated_at":"2020-10-06T07:04:13.453Z"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
