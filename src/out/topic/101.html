When VicForests logs outside the boundaries set out in the Allocation Order, VicForests is logging and selling timber that has not been vested to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDanya Jacobs, Lawyer for Environmental Justice Australia, said: “The allocation order cannot legally grant timber to VicForests if it doesn’t identify where that timber is. If the Department is right that the map in the order is too poor to know whether any given logging operation is taking allocated timber or not, then it raises the prospect that the order has not effectively granted VicForests property in any timber at all. The result being that VicForests logging operations may have been unlawful everywhere since 2013.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEd Hill, Forest Campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: “The logging regulator, the Environment Department, doesn’t know if it’s Arthur or Martha. This latest mapping excuse from the department further demonstrates that when it comes to enforcement, the department has neither the fortitude nor capability to ensure VicForests complies with the law.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The environment department has consistently failed in its role as the regulator of VicForests. This is why there is an independent expert panel review its capability and capacity to effectively regulate VicForests and the adequacies of its prosecution policies, procedures and practices.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWilderness Society Victorian Campaigns Manager Amelia Young said: “If this Environment Department was in charge of land titles, you could claim half your neighbour’s property and say the map was too fuzzy to prove otherwise. If this government is using fuzzy PDF maps to build the Metro Tunnel, it could come out in the middle of the Yarra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“If the government can’t say whether or not VicForests is logging inside or outside the Allocation Order anywhere across eastern Victoria — which is the effect of its statement — then how can Victorians, or the markets, be confident that any of VicForests logging conducted under this Allocation Order since 2013, is above board?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVicForests sells wood from Victoria’s native forests to Nippon-owned paper manufacturer, Australian Paper, which manufactures brands including Reflex products. VicForests wood products are also sold by retail giants Officeworks and Bunnings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs Young said: “There are serious questions over VicForests’ ability to responsibly and sustainably manage Victoria’s native forests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In a few days we’ll have a new Victorian government. VicForests may not be not best placed to manage Victoria’s publicly owned native forests. VicForests must stop logging in all high environmental value forests immediately.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMs Jacobs said: “These are clearly deep problems. There is a crisis with forest regulation in Victoria, which is paralleled by the crisis in the ecology of the forests themselves. Mountain Ash forests are listed as Critically Endangered under international criteria, and yet our regulatory system permits logging to continue in that forest. We are seeing species dependant on these forests uplisted to Critically Endangered, and species that were once common are now rare and threatened.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Now, we find out that VicForests appears to have been logging timber that doesn’t belong to it and the government’s response is effectively that it’s not sure what forest it has handed over to VicForests.

So long as hundreds of thousands of tonnes of forest is dedicated for paper pulp, it will be impossible for DELWP to properly regulate logging in ever-diminishing forests to anything near acceptable standards.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We have called for a truly independent logging regulator, which enforces the code without fear or favour. The extent to which VicForests continues to log high environmental value forests in breach of the law will be a key test of whether DELWP transforms into a regulator that protects the environment, rather than turns a blind eye to its destruction.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eENGO responses to some of the review recommendations\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecommendation 4, to change the focus from the point of harvesting, to the point of planning, is welcome as it should mean earlier intervention is possible to prevent harm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will require exerting greater control over where and when VicForests can and cannot go into certain coupes. The DELWP pre-logging survey program is experiencing challenges with VicForests rushing to go into logging coupes and then DELWP has to rush to complete a survey. This is a reactive not a proactive approach that focuses on the planning stage. In order to do this DELWP will need to work more closely with the Department of Jobs, Precincts and\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegions (DJPR) to exert greater control over VicForests.

How could the RFAs consider climate change and other large-scale natural disturbances (including bushfires)?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccept scientific reports linking logged forest areas (for timber and paper production) to dryer landscapes, loss of rainforest understorey species and consequently an increased fire-risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegeneration burns after logging further add to this risk, and do not meet the same regulatory standards that are imposed on other industries for incineration of waste.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRestoration of Cool Temperate and Warm Temperate rainforest species reduces fire risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eQ 13. How could the RFAs better address industry sustainability?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnsure adequate funding for establishing plantations and manage for longer rotations so they can supply timber not just paper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eQ 14. How could the RFAs encourage investment and new market opportunities for forest-based industries (including the forests and wood products industry, tourism, apiary and emerging markets such as carbon)?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarbon sequestration is the most important investment for the future, as it is critical to achieving emission reduction targets. Other viable uses and industries (water security, beekeeping, seed supply for plant nurseries) are compatible where forest is retained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSupply of water from the de-salination plant is equal to the loss of catchment water yield after logging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eQ 15. How can the RFAs support the adaptive management of Victoria’s forests in response to emerging issues (e.g. major bushfires) and opportunities (e.g. emerging industries)?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere should be no experimentation at the expense of threatened species habitat, under any guise. Ecologically sustainable forest management (ESFM) is best evaluated away from public native forest, with plantations for timber \u0026amp; paper, using accounting \u0026amp; inventory systems realistic for a viable future resource.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eQ 16. What areas of research would better equip us to sustainably manage Victoria’s forests?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrent research shows that the forest has been managed unsustainably under the RFAs, and needs the opportunity to recover. This has resulted in increasing degradation of threatened species habitat, and diminished areas for species survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew research could investigate ways to best achieve a recovery of lost forest values so that further extinctions can be avoided: to restore the forest to its former condition will take hundreds of years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eQ 17. How could RFA monitoring, review (including five-yearly reviews) and reporting arrangements be improved?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe RFA process to date has failed on all reporting milestones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere has been a culture of forest degradation, and there is no point in continuation of this trend.\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen the Victorian RFAs expire, they should be allowed to lapse, and transition to new industry goals in the plantation sector implemented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePlease respond to the \u003ca href=\"https://engage.vic.gov.au/future-of-our-forests/rfa-consultation-paper\"\u003eRFA Survey here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUSEFUL BACKGROUND INFORMATION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVIDEO EXPLAINER: \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1945623385685806\"\u003eWhat is a Regional Forest Agreement (RFA)\u003c/a\u003e?
