All over the eastern states, people were raising concerns about the rapid expansion of coal and coal seam gas development. A declaration was made: farmers would lock their gates to these rapacious industries. Ten years on and the Alliance continues to gain momentum, with rural and urban communities all over Australia stepping up to defend our land, water, and future from the invasive coal and unconventional gas industries.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/original/1X/4b2a8b4e4fba268562b78c3b00a2ac687ad54faf.png\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"aIWXz3OmKIlk2jdAtDqoN4Vhmvd\" width=\"461\" height=\"329\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.lockthegate.org.au/our_work\"><strong>Find out more about what we do and how we do it!</strong></a></p>\n<p>Read more about the history of the Lock the Gate Alliance: <a href=\"https://www.lockthegate.org.au/about_us#\">Show more.</a></p>\n<p>Lock the Gate’s work is guided by a set of principles and aims: <a href=\"https://www.lockthegate.org.au/about_us#\">Read our principles and aims.</a></p>\n<p>In working to achieve our aims the Alliance has adopted a set of policy objectives: <a href=\"https://www.lockthegate.org.au/about_us#\">Read our policy objectives.</a></p>\n<p>The Alliance has adopted a policy of peaceful behaviour in all our work: <a href=\"https://www.lockthegate.org.au/about_us#\">Read our Policy of Peaceful Action.</a></p>\n<p>You can get in touch with Lock the Gate at the following addresses: <a href=\"https://www.lockthegate.org.au/about_us#\">Contact us.</a></p>\n<p>Lock the Gate Alliance is a registered charity in Australia: <a href=\"https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/2bb62de6055eb13e29b1597b814f2058\">Charity details here.</a></p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/original/1X/4a680486dea9c02ba56d74359e1a9f2fee9c5d66.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/4a680486dea9c02ba56d74359e1a9f2fee9c5d66\" title=\"\"><img src=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/original/1X/4a680486dea9c02ba56d74359e1a9f2fee9c5d66.jpeg\" alt=\"\" data-base62-sha1=\"aCebL5WyEZ8O1KpBo5chGNW8jIO\" width=\"517\" height=\"268\" data-small-upload=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/optimized/1X/4a680486dea9c02ba56d74359e1a9f2fee9c5d66_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\"></span><span class=\"informations\">1024×532 115 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>","updated_at":"2020-10-06T07:36:14.925Z"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
