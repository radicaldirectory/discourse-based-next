The minimum wage you are paid is not a Living Wage. A Living Wage is a wage which allows you and your family to buy bread and other necessities of life, but also to actually live! Imagine not having to worry about the rent or mortgage, or the next bill, or school costs or all the other things which are part of living. Imagine being able to afford some nice flowers or a nice meal out more often. A Living Wage is about more than surviving. Itâ€™s about living!</p>\n<p>A living wage is calculated as 60% of the Median Full-Time Adult Wage in Australia. The median is a measure of the midpoint. If you lined up every full-time adult wage in Australia, the one in the very middle would be about $42 per hour. Just as many full-time adult workers earn less as those that earn more than $42 per hour. Many earn a great deal more. The Australian Living Wage is 60% of this median $42 per hour.</p>\n<p><strong>In Australia, a Living Wage is $25 per hour.</strong></p>\n<p>We believe every worker deserves a Living Wage. We believe every worker deserves at least $25 per hour before any penalty rates or casual loading. Every worker deserves a Living Wage.</p>\n<p>Join our fight for a Living Wage. <span class=\"hashtag\">#fightforalivingwage</span> #fightfor$25</p>\n<p>Join the campaign here: <a href=\"https://raffwu.org.au/campaigns/industry/living-wages/\">https://raffwu.org.au/campaigns/industry/living-wages/</a></p>","updated_at":"2020-10-06T07:06:53.766Z"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
