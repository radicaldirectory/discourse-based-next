We promote the cultural, legal, human, occupational and civil rights of all sex workers. Vixen Collective is an unfunded organisation run entirely by sex workers volunteering our time and energy. ‘Peer-only’ means that our organisation is made up of current and former sex workers. Peer-only sex worker organisations do not allow the owners and operators of sex industry businesses, or ancillary staff in the sex industry (people such as managers, receptionists, drivers and cleaners) to participate. We are an organisation run by sex workers, for sex workers.</p>\n<p>Victoria has a proud sex worker history. With the advent of HIV in the 1980s, Australia led the world by deploying a community-based response. Money was given to key communities - sex workers, gay men, injecting drug users - to form their own organisations to contribute to the fight against the virus.  Melbourne was the first place in the world to commit funding to a sex worker organisation - the Prostitutes Collective of Victoria (PCV).  The PCV were pioneers in sex worker organising.  However, in 2001 the PCV was taken over by a community health service and it ceased being a peer-only organisation.</p>\n<p>In 2005, Vixen Collective was started by a group of Victorian sex workers and launched at the 2005 <a href=\"http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/\">Scarlet Alliance, Australian Sex Workers Association</a>, national forum. In 2007, Vixen Collective became a member of Scarlet Alliance. Vixen Collective has continued to engage in sex worker rights, building participation of local sex workers, as well as developing links to state and national sex worker organisations.</p>\n<p>Vixen Collective continues to work fiercely on sex worker rights in Victoria, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ongoing and active consultation with Victorian sex workers</li>\n<li>Peer education and peer support to local sex worker community</li>\n<li>Education initiatives with broader non-sex worker community</li>\n<li>Advocacy and lobbying</li>\n<li>Fighting stigma and discrimination against sex workers</li>\n<li>HIV advisory</li>\n<li>Media</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Vixen Collective’s work is informed by ongoing consultation with Victorian sex workers, as well as the broader sex worker community across Australia and internationally.</p>\n<p>Vixen Collective, supports the full decriminalisation of sex work of all forms of sex work, as this is the model upheld as being best practice for sex workers’ health and safety, as well as being the model supported by respected organisations including (but not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2017/june/20170602_sexwork\">The United Nations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.who.int/hiv/topics/sex_work/about/en/\">The World Health Organisation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol30/4062/2016/en/\">Amnesty International</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.gaatw.org/resources/e-bulletin/819-gaatw-is-comment-amnesty-international-calls-for-the-decriminalisation-of-sex-work\">Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women (GAATW)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/08/07/why-sex-work-should-be-decriminalized\">Human Rights Watch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hivlawcommission.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/HIV-and-the-Law-Sex-Workers-Fact-Sheet.pdf\">Global Commission on HIV and the Law</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/publications/ten-reasons-decriminalize-sex-work\">Open Society Foundations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ach2.org.au/Websites/ach2/files/Content/3129792/Sixth_National_HIV_Strategy.pdf\">Australia’s National HIV Strategies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.burnet.edu.au/about\">Burnet Institute</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.latrobe.edu.au/arcshs/about\">Australian Research Centre in Sex Health &amp; Society (ARCSHS)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.afao.org.au/article/decriminalisation-sex-work-evidence/\">Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations (AFAO)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thorneharbour.org/about/policy-advocacy/\">Thorne Harbour Health</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://livingpositivevictoria.org.au/poslink/legally-sexy-hiv-rights/\">Living Positive Victoria</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hrvic.org.au/\">Harm Reduction Victoria</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.skls.org.au/legal-help/sex-work/\">St Kilda Legal Service</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/series/HIV-and-sex-workers\">Multiple medical studies</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nswp.org/\">Global Network of Sex Work Projects </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.weareunion.org.au/\">Victorian Trades Hall Council</a></li>\n<li>Sex workers’ representative organisations in Australia</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vixencollective.org/contact-us\">Get in touch</a> if you support sex workers and would like to see organisation added to this list!</p>\n<p>Vixen Collective is based on the unceded lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation.
