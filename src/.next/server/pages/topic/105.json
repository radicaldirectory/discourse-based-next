So that we can reach our RISE members and not rely on volunteer’s vehicles, we are asking for your help to purchase a refrigerated truck. As well as increasing our capacity and improving the reliability of our program, this will also mean that we can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be more time efficient in delivering critical essentials to RISE members and families.</li>\n<li>Store meat, fresh fruits and vegetables safely and for longer.</li>\n<li>Increase food storage capacity.</li>\n<li>Be able to fill the gaps left by other “agencies” by directly responding to the needs of our members.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Donate here: <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/risefoodtruck?fbclid=IwAR2ITBqh5A1FgtRXqeh5jkLLHfWqEajlOFAaG-pfk0lsW7VvK3l401gRmoA\">https://www.gofundme.com/f/risefoodtruck?fbclid=IwAR2ITBqh5A1FgtRXqeh5jkLLHfWqEajlOFAaG-pfk0lsW7VvK3l401gRmoA</a></p>","updated_at":"2020-10-06T07:01:26.129Z"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
