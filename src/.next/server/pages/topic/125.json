We believe in the benefits of an autonomous space that supports and deepens our networks of solidarity.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we want to say a huge thank-you to everyone who donated to our recent fundraiser and who continue to donate to our mutual aid food boxes.</p>\n<p><strong>This fundraiser we want to raise money for both rent and the mutual aid food boxes. We would like to raise $10000 to be able to make xmas/holiday hampers (with gifts), and to continue to be able to support families for as long as we can. We are also trying to raise $10000 to cover rent from December 2020 until May 2021.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We have been using the space to organise a COVID-19 Mutual Aid food support, putting together and delivering up to 60 food boxes weekly to suburbs around Melbourne, independe</strong> <strong>ntly and in partnership with Blackfulla Mutual Aid and SE mutual aid. We want to be able to continue doing this. The impacts of COVID-19 are ongoing and the food boxes cost around $2000 weekly.</strong></p>\n<p>Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic IRL was used by people and groups to run workshops, meetings, trainings and social activities. It is home to Incendium Radical Library and Undercurrent Community Education Project.  Some of the events that have run out of the space regularly include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prisoner letter writing</li>\n<li>Gomeroi / Gamilaraay language and discussion group</li>\n<li>Drawing class</li>\n<li>Meditation</li>\n<li>Various readings groups</li>\n<li>Healing through art series- Fam’d up comedy</li>\n<li>Accountability series</li>\n<li>Campaign meetings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To see all the events and projects that have run out of the space for the last 2 and a 1/2 years check out our website or instagram.</p>\n<p>We have extended the lease from December until May 2021 and we have a huge desire to find a new (bigger) space, to support and amplify community based organising and movement building. More on this to come.</p>\n<p>Any financial support would be greatly appreciated and will enable us to continue doing the mutual aid work around Narrm.</p>\n<p>We want to also acknowledge that there is so much going on right now and so many places, people and projects greatly in need of $$ support. We urge you to also donate to:</p>\n<p>Black Fulla Mutual Aid: <a href=\"https://chuffed.org/project/covid-19-first-nations-fund\">https://chuffed.org/project/covid-19-first-nations-fund</a><br>\nWAR: bsb 313 140, account no. 12267176<br>\nRISE: <a href=\"https://www.givenow.com.au/riserefugee/donate\">https://www.givenow.com.au/riserefugee/donate</a><br>\nIRL mutual aid: bsb 633000, 163846009 or <a href=\"http://paypal.me/irlinfoshop\">paypal.me/irlinfoshop</a></p>\n<p>In solidarity,<br>\nIRL Irlinfoshop</p>\n<p>ACABFiretotheprisons</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://assets.squarespace.com/universal/default-favicon.ico\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\">\n      <a href=\"https://www.irlinfoshop.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IRL Infoshop</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"aspect-image\" style=\"--aspect-ratio:500/453;\"><img src=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/original/1X/a753e65da9a786ad12b80b5f18c9347c8a8cadc0.png\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"500\" height=\"453\"></div>\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.irlinfoshop.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IRL Infoshop</a></h3>\n\n\n\n  </article>\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n<br>\n<aside class=\"onebox allowlistedgeneric\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n      <img src=\"https://radical.directory/uploads/default/original/1X/18fea4ad0371ed6cd21007f24a47812ba09b8fa1.png\" class=\"site-icon\" width=\"192\" height=\"192\">\n      <a href=\"https://instagram.com/irlinfoshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">instagram.com</a>\n  </header>\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <img src=\"\" class=\"thumbnail\" width=\"\" height=\"\">\n\n<h3><a href=\"https://instagram.com/irlinfoshop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Login • Instagram</a></h3>\n\n\n\n  </article>\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>IRL is situated on the land of the Wurundjeri &amp; Bunurong peoples of the Kulin Nation.
